Description: 'fgeo' installs and loads multiple R packages
    of ForestGEO in a single step. Each individual package is a
    self-contained module. Together, all the packages in 'fgeo' provide a
    wide range of tools to analyze forest diversity and dynamics. The
    modular structure of 'fgeo' makes it easy to add and maintain more
    tools as they become available. Learn more about the 'fgeo' package at
    <http://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo>; and learn more about ForestGEO at
    <http://www.forestgeo.si.edu/>.
