# fgeo (development version)

* Work in progress.

# fgeo 1.1.2 ([GitHub](https://github.com/forestgeo/fgeo/releases) and [drat](https://forestgeo.github.io/drat/))

This release marks that all __fgeo__ packages now meet CRAN standards. 

Most changes are internal, and focused on making __fgeo__ more reliable and easier to maintain:

* We now enforce that your R version is 3.2 or greater.
* Error messages are now clearer when you attach __fgeo__ and outdated dependencies are detected.
* We now check that __fgeo__ builds correctly on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
The website now builds automatically if __fgeo__ passes all checks on Travis CI. Automated builds of all __fgeo__ packages can be tracked at <https://travis-ci.org/forestgeo/>, and on to the `#fgeo-builds` channel of [ForestGEO's slack workspace](https://forestgeo.slack.com/) ([request an invitation](https://github.com/forestgeo/forum/issues/new)).

Many thanks to those who [reviewed](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/authors.html) __fgeo__ for your contribution in making it better.
